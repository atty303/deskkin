# Current status

This file is the current working-state handoff, not a history or activity log.
Replace stale entries as work starts, changes, or completes; use version-control
history for prior states and rationale.

## Baseline

The portable application and protocol crates, Linux host and simulator, CoreS3
product and inert-recovery firmware, physical-host profiles, and reproducible
tooling are implemented. The current source and tests define the executable
baseline. See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and
[`docs/core-s3.md`](docs/core-s3.md) for the maintained contracts.

No external provider connector is implemented. The deterministic availability
connector does not access an external service.

## Active work

None.

## Next work

No product slice is currently approved. Select and explicitly approve the next
slice, its authority, and any dependency additions before implementation.
